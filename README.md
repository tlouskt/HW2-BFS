# Breadth first search
The goal of the project is to implement breadth first search on directed graphs. The bfs function can traverse a graph and find the shortest path between two nodes. The method uses the Networkx library and the Queue module. Given a starting node, the method will visit and store neighboring nodes. If an end node is specified, the method will give the shortest path between the two nodes. To return the shortest path, a dictionary is used to store parent nodes.
